# FNFest-Content-API

A more human-readable version of Epic's public content API for Fortnite Festival.
You can grab [`fnfest_content_api.json`](https://levisnoot.github.io/FNFest-Content-API/api/fnfest_content_api.json) if you want everything in one place. Otherwise you can fetch the individual songs by their track ID. For example [`track_api/butterbarnhoedown.json`](https://levisnoot.github.io/FNFest-Content-API/api/track_api/butterbarnhoedown.json).

An API index can be found at the github pages root: https://levisnoot.github.io/FNFest-Content-API/
